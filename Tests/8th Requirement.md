### Future Features: ###
#### Cordova: To Do List Application must run as a mobile application ####
### Test case no 1: ###
#### Mobile Application ####
- GIVEN the application is ported to Cordova
- WHEN when a mobile emulation device is selected
- THEN the user should be able to run the application on the selected mobile device

#### Test Strategy: ####
- In order for the To Do list application to run as a mobile app on Cordova, we would need to install an Android SDK (Software development kit) that Cordova supports. 
- Import the application to Cordova and select Android as a platform in the config file
- The application can then be run on the selected platform
- Testing of the mobile application will include all functional requirements, error handling and usability
